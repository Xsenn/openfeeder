After building the feeder and uploading Arduino code, you can test the feeder in one of the following ways.<br>
1) Click 'Serial Monitor' button on the upper right corner of the Arduino app, a serial monitor window will be opened,<br>
   then type 'feed' in the upper text box of the new window.<br>
2) Download 'test.py' file and run it with Python ('pyserial', https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyserial, is required),<br>
   then click 'Feed' button.
